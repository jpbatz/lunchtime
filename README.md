# lunchtime
Automating the most important task at work.

This is a tool that will search for a lunch venue based on what a user wants/does not want, type of cuisine, type of food, and distance in miles.  This tool requires the lunch2.csv but would like to eventually use the yelp api.  

In progress:

1)  Scroll bars on the listboxes with a view of 10 items
2)  Logic for the selections made (need to include fast food and logic for distance selection)
3)  A button that will make a random selection
4)  make "preference" field required
5)  Create a frame for results that will clear with the "Clear" button
